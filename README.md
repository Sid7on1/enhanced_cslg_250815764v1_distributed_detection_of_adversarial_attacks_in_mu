Project Documentation: Enhanced AI Project for Distributed Detection of Adversarial Attacks in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

This project is based on the research paper "Distributed Detection of Adversarial Attacks in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Action Space" by Kiarash Kazaria, Ezzeldin Shereena, and György Dána.

The project aims to develop a decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior of observable agents.

The detector utilizes deep neural networks to approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, a normality score is defined and its mean and variance are characterized.

This project implements the algorithms and methods described in the research paper, including the velocity-threshold and Flow Theory algorithms.

The project is designed to be modular and maintainable, with a clear separation of concerns between different components.
